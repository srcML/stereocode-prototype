__doc__ = """

The main file that's used for executing stereocode from the command line.
    * This file handles the following:
    1) Command-line parameter handling
    2) I/O interfacing with an archive/file/Collection of source code files/pipes
        then handing that off to srcML to be annotated/processed.
    3) Outputting to either the command line, file or archive as desired.
